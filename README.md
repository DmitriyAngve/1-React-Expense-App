# 25-MyJSON-Server-Setup

In this React app I learned about JSX, about what components are, how build my own components and how I can use them, how I can work with them. In additional I learned how work with data in React apps. Basically, I learned all important key concepts, which I need over again in any React app in future.

<h3 align="center">About App:<h3>
 
<div>- It's an expense tracker. You can see your expenses by year using the filter. Depending on the filter, the user interface is automatically updated with animation.</div>
<div>- You can add new expenses by adding what you see as the chart is updated.</div>
